# interlink-condorce-plugin ü¶§ üêç
A helm chart deploying an interlink plugin redirecting jobs to a remote condor CE

Enabling offloading Kubernetes tasks to HTCondor is of critical importance to unload the CPUs of machines providing
GPUs and FPGAs from High Throughput Computing tasks, that only require CPUs to be performed.
In this repository we provide an implementation of an InterLink plugin for a remote HTCondor Computing EntryPoint 
(condor-ce). 

The remote condor-ce is authenticated using IAM tokens, however, in general, the IAM issuer used to 
authenticate HTC resources may differ from the IAM used for Kubernetes, so this plugin define two different IAM 
issuer for authenticating the incoming requests from a remote Kubernetes cluster and the outgoing HTCondor calls.

## Chart structure
The logical flow of an incoming computation request is as follows:
1. This cluster defines a TLS-certified HTTPS ingress to the general Internet
   (see [cert-manager.yaml](templates/cert-manager.yaml)); 
2. The remote Kubernetes cluster gets authenticated via Bearer token by an **OAuth2Proxy** instance
   (see [server.yaml](templates/server.yaml));
3. The authenticated request is passed to an **InterLink API server** (see [server.yaml](templates/server.yaml));
4. A specialized **InterLink plugin** for condor (see [plugin.yaml](templates/plugin.yaml)), 
   authenticated against the HTCondor backend
   (see [authenticator.yaml](templates/authenticator.yaml)), converts and submit the requests.

## Support for shubProxy
When running apptainer to emulate an OCI runtime in a distributed environment, it is necessary to rethink the caching 
procedure to avoid each single job to re-download the image from docker hub and rebuild it.
To this purpose, we use ShubProxy ([Singularity Hub Proxy](github.com/landerlini/shub-proxy)) which accepts docker 
images by name through a simple REST API and redirect the client to a presigned URL from a backend object storage, 
if available, otherwise it build the image, upload it and return the presigned URL.

To avoid abuse of the proxy from unauthorized clients, a very simple authorization procedure is put in place. 
A master token is shared between the plugin and the proxy. When submitting jobs, the master token is presented to 
the proxy to obtain a client token with limited validity (usually 100 days). Jobs can then use the token to download 
their image passing it as an `X-Token` header to the GET request to the ShubProxy endpoint.

### Minimal `values.yaml`

```yaml
# hostname
hostname: <insert here the fully qualified domain name, without protocol>

# IAM authenticating incoming requests
oauth2ProxyIamIssuer: <iam-issuer>
oauth2ProxyIamClientId: <client-id>
oauth2ProxyIamClientSecret: <client-secret>
oauth2ProxyCookieSecret: <a random string of 16 chars to be used as encryption key>

# IAM authenticating outgoind requests
backendIamIssuer: <iam-issuer>
backendIamClientId: <client-id>
backendIamClientSecret: <client-secret>

# Singularity Hub Proxy used to cache built singularity images in a distributed environment
backendShubProxy: <backend shub proxy>
backendShubProxyMasterToken: <master token of shub proxy>

# Condor configuration
pluginCondorPool: <value one would pass to condor -pool argument, with port>
pluginCondorScheduler: <value one would pass to condor -name argument>

# hostname
certManagerEmailAddress: <your e-mail>
```

### Dependencies 
 * helm
 * cert-manager: https://cert-manager.io/docs/installation/

## Specialized plugin
The plugin is composed of a general package to convert a Kubernetes Pod and a set of volumes into a bash script 
relying on apptainer (or singularity) for the container runtime interface 
(see [apptainer_cmd_builder](natsprovider/apptainer_cmd_builder)). 
A condor-specific machinery to submit generic payloads to a remote condor backend is coded in the 
[CondorConfiguration module](natsprovider/CondorConfiguration.py).
Finally, [CondorProvider](natsprovider/CondorProvider.py) defines methods to convert Kubernetes Pods into 
bash scripts and submit them to the condor backend. 

The CondorProvider is wrapped in a FastAPI application defined in [main.py](natsplugin.py) exposing InterLink plugin APIs.


### Dependencies 
The full list of dependencies of the plugin can be found in the [Dockerfile](docker/Dockerfile). 

They include the htcondor CLI, oidc-agent and Python. 
Apptainer is used for local testing. 

The plugin application depends on the following Python packages 
 * uvicorn
 * fastapi
 * pyyaml
 * jinja2
 * pytest
 * kubernetes
 * htcondor
